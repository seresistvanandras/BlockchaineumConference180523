# evoting smart contract workshop for Blockchaineum 2.0 Conference in Budapest, 2018 May 23rd

# This is how you should use this little demo

1) Start testrpc

2) truffle migrate --reset (to deploy the contract on testrpc)

3) npm install (to install all the dependencies needed for the node.js server) 

4) npm run dev ( to run the node.js server)
 
5) go run go_postman.go (in the src/go folder to set up the go server)

6) open a browser and go to localhost:8080 and then you play with the contract using the minimalistic user interface

7) First you need to register an eligible voter in the admin interface to be able to cast a vote from that specific address, then from that address you will be able to cast a vote

#ENJOY!
