# evoting smart contract workshop for Blockchaineum 2.0 Conference in Budapest, 2018 May 23rd

# This is how you should use this little demo

# Start testrpc
# truffle migrate --reset (to deploy the contract on testrpc)
# npm run dev ( to run the node.js server)
# go run go_postman.go (in the src/go folder to set up the go server)
# open a browser and go to localhost:8080 and then you play with the contract using the minimalistic user interface

#ENJOY!
